# Contextual button

## Usage

It can only be used for actions that happen on the same screen that affect an element on that screen. One example would be “Copy to clipboard”.

## Emphasis

A contextual button is an action with a **low communication weight**. It's an action of little importance associated with an interface component. It would be like whispering to the user to tell them the action can be done.
