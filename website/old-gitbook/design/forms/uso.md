# Use

The forms are used to obtain information and guide people. Designing the forms well requires making decisions about their flow, structure and their various component parts.

## Good practices

A form is a conversation. And just like all conversations, this needs to be structured in a logical way, between two parties: in this case, between the user and our app. With the aim of building forms that facilitate coherent communication through our product, making this process as easy as possible for users, we've compiled several tips that can help us improve usability:

* **Request only the necessary information:** We recommend deleting the fields whose information can be: collected in another way; collected later; or simply deleted. Remember that short forms increase the conversion ratio. 
* **Use section titles** to group together related fields, helping to provide more context and facilitate interface scanning. 
* **Follow a logical and predictable order**: For example, we'll first request the credit card number, followed by the expiration date and lastly the CVV number.
