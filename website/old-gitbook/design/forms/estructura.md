# Structure

When a user accesses a form, we must, insofar as possible, avoid showing a large number of fields that require filling out, since this can frustrate the user when completing the form. 

While it may be difficult to ascertain whether or not a form is very long, the type of flow or context can help us when structuring the different steps. We at Novum recommend designing forms with a maximum of 3 fields per step, as long as these fields are of the same type.

## Multi-step forms

This technique can be used to distribute form fields across more than one screen, incorporating the use of a progress bar or a stepper to ensure that users are aware of their status at all times. When using this feature, each screen should show groupings of fields that are of the same type e.g. city, state and post code.

## Layout of form elements

To organise the fields within a form, we have a modular layout that allows us to modify their distribution in accordance with our requirements. The layout can assume the form of **a single column**, which will be the default option, that stacks the fields vertically; **two columns**, allowing us to horizontally group related fields; or **a combination of both layouts** throughout the form.

### One-column layout

This layout allows us to stack the fields vertically, which makes it easier for users to scan through and complete a form.

### Two-column layout

If we need to distribute multiple fields in the same row, we'll use this two-column layout. We'll restrict its use for related fields, which require the user to enter a little bit of information. Remember that the fields in the two-column format are not as wide as those in the one-column format; as such, they serve as reference or visual orientation for the user in fields where 1 to 4 characters must be entered.

{% hint style="info" %}
As we have mentioned above, we can combine the one-column and two-column layouts throughout the form. The fields for entering a payment method are a clear example of the combination of full-width fields immediately followed by two side-by-side fields in the two-column format.
