# Design

As a designer, **every Novum experience that you design should be clear, concise and consistent, as well as predictable and effective**.   
Design guidelines about some specific components can be found in this website with the aim of making it clearer to you how to apply that consistent experience.

Whenever designing experiences for our users, **keep our guidelines in mind and try to fit your design needs with the possibilities given in this documentation**. If you donâ€™t find any case that fits for your needs, please reach out to us so that we may take it into account. 

Remember that **our guidelines are continuously revised and expanded** to suit changing product needs, so as time goes on you'll be able to find more and better information to design Novum products.
