Actions allow users to submit a completed form.

## Positioning of the buttons on forms

The buttons shall remain fixed to the bottom of the screen. When the keyboard is displayed, it will appear over the buttons.

## Keyboard actions

To facilitate navigation through a form, users can use the actions that are available in the keyboard toolbar.

### Alphanumeric, numeric and picker keyboards

In a form, the lower right part of alphanumeric, numeric and picker keyboards have a function that allows the user to move to the next field \(**Next**\), before marking the action as completed \(**Done**\) once they have reached the final field. Once the user has tapped **Done**, the keyboard will disappear. Then, it will be the action of the CTA that allows the process to continue.

By tapping anywhere on the screen \(as long as it is not an input field\), the keyboard will disappear.
