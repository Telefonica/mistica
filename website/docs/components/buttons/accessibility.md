Digital accessibility is the practice of building digital content and applications that can be used by a wide range of people, including people with visual, motor, hearing, language or cognitive disabilities. ‌

Certain accessibility patterns must be considered and respected for our buttons.

### Accessibility settings

Users with disabilities can change the interaction and experience with certain applications through the operating system settings.

If the user enables these settings, some properties of the buttons will change to enhance their contrast, accessibility and interaction. In short, to adapt its use to those users with different disabilities.

### Colours

The colours of the buttons will change when a user activates the accessible modes of their device. The colours will be more accessible and have more contrast.

### Size

When a user is in accessible mode, the buttons should be larger so they can be seen properly and interacted with. The size of the container and the size of the text should both be increased.

### Focus State

Buttons should have a focus state that shows when the user's navigation element is on a button in order to handle the requirements of keyboard navigation. The focus state of the operating system will be used.

### ALT text attribute

People with a visual disability navigate our application by listening to the description of every element of the interface. For buttons, they will hear the text content.

In some circumstance, an alternative text should be provided describing the function of the button in a more specific way. For example, on a row of contacts with a “delete” button, the user may understand better if the descriptive audio tells them “delete this contact”.
