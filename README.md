### What is Mística?

<br>

Mística is Telefónica CX design system, a system that responds to our specific circumstances.<br>
The aim of Mistica is to help Telefonica designers and developers deliver work faster and better. It provides teams with a common language and encourages adherence to design guidelines with compliant components right out of the box.
<br>

- <b>It is the language of the entire Telefónica CX universe</b><br>
Mística enables us to have a universal language with which to develop our products.

- <b>Consistency in all our products</b><br>
This consistency will be reflected in a better, unique and consistent user experience.

- <b>Optimizing the design process</b><br>
Mística reduces design and development time in order to be able to put more effort into improving and evolving our product.

- <b>Flexibility and optimization</b><br>
Iterations and improvements will be carried out at all times based on the needs and points of improvement that we identify among ourselves.


We are currently building our roadmap and initial components inventory to estimate the v1 release date. We are in active development and testing with selected teams, so the components API may change frequently. However, you can play with the alpha version today! Your feedback will help us shape Mistica.
