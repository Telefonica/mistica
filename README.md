### What is Mística?

<br>

Mística is Telefónica´s Digital Design System. An open and collaborative system for the whole ecosystem of digital products and services in Telefónica.

It is a common design language that provides tools and guidelines with compliant components to deliver your next Telefónica’s digital experience.

The aim of Mistica is to help Telefonica designers and developers deliver work faster and better. It provides teams with a common language and encourages adherence to design guidelines with compliant components right out of the box.
