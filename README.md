### What is a design system?

> “A set of shared and integrated principles and patterns that define the overall design of a product.” — Karri Saarinen @ Airbnb

The aim of Mistica is to help Telefonica designers and developers deliver work faster and better. It provides teams with a common language and encourages adherence to design guidelines with compliant components right out of the box.

We are currently building our roadmap and initial components inventory to estimate the v1 release date. We are in active development and testing with selected teams, so the components API may change frequently. However, you can play with the alpha version today! Your feedback will help us shape Mistica.
