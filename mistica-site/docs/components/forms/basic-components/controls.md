Controls are found in the selection lists contained in the forms. We're going to distinguish between **three scenarios** in which these components may be found:

1. Select a single action
2. Select a single action from a list
3. Select multiple options from a list

### 1. Select a single action

#### Checkboxes

We can use checkboxes as a single selection element. The terms and conditions component is an example of a single selection for which a checkbox is used. In these cases the control will always appear disabled, with the user required to activate it when accepting said terms and conditions.

### 2. Select a single action from a list

#### Radio buttons

Selection element that allows the user to choose a single option from a predefined set of mutually exclusive options. We recommend using option groups with radio buttons when we have a list of 2-3 options and we want the users to fill out the form quickly.

#### Dropdown

For long lists including more than three actions.

### 3. Select multiple options from a list

#### Checkboxes

Selection element that allows the user to make multiple selections from a set of options. Its use is recommended when there are lists with several options and the user can select any number of options including zero, one or more than one.
