These inform users about the **status of the ongoing steps**. To see the progress of a sequence of steps, we will indicate the overall progress instead of the progress of each one of the steps.

There are two types of progress indicators:

* **Determined:** These show how long a process will last. They should be used when the steps within a process can be detected, and will be visually represented with a Stepper. 
* **Undetermined:** These indicate an unspecified amount of waiting time. They are used for pages and processes where the user has to complete several steps and we don't know the number of steps that the process consists of. For these cases we will use a Progress Bar.
