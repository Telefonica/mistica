# Primary button

![Primary button applied to different brands](../img/typology_primary.png)

## Usage

The primary button is used to represent the most important action on the screen. It's the interactive interface element that should have the greatest visual and structural weight. Ideally, there should only be **one primary button on a screen**, and it should be the button used most in flows and processes.

## Hierarchy

When it's accompanied by other actions, it will be the element at the **top of the hierarchy**, and consequently, it should be positioned in the **first place**.

## Emphasis

The primary button puts a **high emphasis** on what it communicates. It would be like yelling at the user so they do an action.

## Anatomy

### Text label

It should describe the action that is going to happen when the user interacts with the button as concisely as possible.

### Container

The background should be a different colour than the control elements to differentiate the functionality between the elements.

### Icon \(optional\)

This element can accompany a text label to communicate a message more clearly.

## States

A primary button can have the following states:

* Normal
* Pressed \(Android\) or Selected \(iOS\)
* Clicked \(Desktop\)
* Loading
* Focus \(this accessibility state is determined by the system\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Buttons must never have a disabled state. Helping users by showing an error message is significantly more effective than using a disabled button and having the user try to figure out the reasons why the button is disabled. That situation frequently makes users decide to give up on a process or even stop using the application.
