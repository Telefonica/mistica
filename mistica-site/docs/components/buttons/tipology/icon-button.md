## Usage

Icon buttons are used as an **interactive area for distribution** to various areas of the app. Icon buttons are never used by themselves.

## Hierarchy

Icon buttons have an equivalent hierarchy between each other. They provide **options with the same hierarchical weight**.

## Emphasis

Icon buttons give a **low emphasis** to what they communicate. It's as if they were murmuring to users they may do a specific action.
