# Buttons

![](../img/buttons_header.png)

This documentation intends to set out guidelines for using the various buttons that are part of Novum's design system, called _Mística_. The goal is to learn about the typologies, when to use each one and how to do so depending on the context we are working with.

‌In the **first part**, we'll talk about use cases, anatomy and the buttons' relationship to the other interface elements and the relationship the buttons have with each other.

‌In the **second part**, we'll define all the buttons and their typology, behaviour and different states and we'll look at some recommendations for using them correctly.
