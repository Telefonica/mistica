### What is an In-App?

An in-app message is a message represented by a full-screen modal used to acknowledge users about new or revamped features within the app for whom they are segmented. This means that the message should be **understandable**, **representative** and **achievable** by the segmented user.

### What is NOT an In-App?

An in-app message is not an element that indicates anything related about new information associated with an existing component or feature in the app nor new marketing promotions. For that goal, thereâ€™s another series of component that can be used with that purpose
