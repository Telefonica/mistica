This documentation establishes which components should designers in Novum incorporate when giving notifications to our users.

**Notifications is a way to acknowledge the user with precise, timely and relevant information about new or existing features also new content within the app.**  

In the first section [Notification scenarios](notifications-scenarios/) we define the different possible scenarios we may find depending on the type of information we want to provide our users. Please read the definition of each scenario carefully in order to find out which component to use for every platform \(iOS, Android and web\).
