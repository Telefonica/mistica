### What is a badge?

A badge is an element used to indicate the user that there is new information associated with any component in the app.

For example, new information could be:

* A new offer in an existing carrousel
* A new message in an existing support chat

### What is not a badge?

A badge is not an element used to indicate the user the existence of new features in the app. Another element should be used for that objective.  


#### What is a new feature and new information in the app?

Letâ€™s explain it with examples:

* New feature: a new area in the app that displays new available plans. 
  * New information: a new plan is included in that area.
* New feature: a new area in the app that shows the latest mobile phone launches. 
  * New information: a new mobile launch is included in that area.

The badge definition is split into 2 types of badge: 

* Non-numeric badge
* Numeric badge.
