  The Section Titles, found at the top of blocks or groupings of similar content
  (lists, cards, etc.), help to organize the on-screen layout and split the
  content into logical fragments of information.

# Section Title

## What isn't a Section Title?

It is NOT a page title.

It is NOT a header or an opening line/paragraph.

## How does it work?

A Section Title **helps to cluster** blocks of information within a form or a list of items i.e. it separates blocks according to groupings of content and information.

A Section Title is **not always necessary**. For instance, in a form or a list with few fields or items, we could decide that the user does not need this content grouping.

## UX Writing

Section Titles will not be conversational. Clear, direct and concise summaries of the information presented in the block will be used, helping the user to quickly analyze the sections that may be of interest to him/her.

Examples of good use \(as a Section Title\)

* Personal information
* Security
* Types of balances

Examples of bad use \(as a Section Title\)

* These are the most common doubts
* For you
* Movistar+ \#0

:::warning
These are bad uses of a Section Title, as they do not help the user to understand what information he/she will find in this block, or they are not clear, direct and concise.
