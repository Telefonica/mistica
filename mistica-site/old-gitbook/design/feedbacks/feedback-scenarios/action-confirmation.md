# Action confirmation

## Definition

We define action confirmation as messages where we want users to confirm an action they just previously triggered by giving them extra information or just to confirm they didnâ€™t perform a destructive action by mistake.

## Component use

Please use:

* For Android a [dialog](../components/android/dialog.md)
* For web a [dialog](../components/web/dialog.md)

For iOS we establish two different scenarios and component uses:

For destructive confirmations, meaning those that result in destroying information \(deleting messages, removing images, etc.\) please use [action sheets](../components/ios/action-sheet.md).

For all other types of confirmations, including abandoning multi-step processes while completing them, please use an [alert](../components/ios/alert.md).
