# Action sheet

We use action sheets for

* [action confirmations](../../feedback-scenarios/action-confirmation.md) \(destructive only\)

## Use considerations

If you need to provide extra information to help users confirm the action, do so. In this case, please use short, descriptive and easy to understand copywriting. Avoid technical jargon and alarming language. Also try to keep messages short enough to fit on one or two lines to prevent scrolling \(80 characters maximum\).

Always provide a Cancel button to add clarity. Cancel buttons should always be included in action sheets at the bottom of the screen.

As we use action sheets to confirm destructive actions, these should always be styled in red color.
