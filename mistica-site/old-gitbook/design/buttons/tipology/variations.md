# Variations

## Inverse buttons

All buttons are designed to drop down over a background with a colour or image where the contrast is changed. There is an inverse version of every button that is always used whenever needed because of the visual context of the screen for this purpose.

## Small buttons

Smaller buttons need to be used for certain components. Using these buttons responds to two kinds of needs:

### 1. Spatial needs

If a large button is used on a small component, the size of the component will need to be increased a lot.

### 2. On screen prominence

A screen should not have a lot of large buttons, because the interface would be almost entirely filled up by them and the main function would get lost and the main functionality of the interface would get lost. Because of that, a list of elements with normal sized buttons should not be used, rather the smaller version should be used.

â€ŒThe buttons that can be made smaller to behave like small buttons are:

* Primary button
* Secondary button
* Danger button

Currently, the small buttons are only used for some components. But, in the future, they can be used in new and other components. The components where they are used are:

* Small Lists
* Empty States
