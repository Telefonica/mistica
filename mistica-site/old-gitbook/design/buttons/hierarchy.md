# Hierarchy

A good hierarchy of buttons is important for the user experience with the interface to be coherent with the goal of every screen.

The hierarchy will be achieved by giving the buttons emphasis and using the **combination** and **coexistence** of buttons on the layout.

## Emphasis

When used properly, emphasis can help directing the user's attention more effectively. â€Œ

Emphasis can be represented on buttons like in a conversation, where there are times you need to yell at the user and times when the action is not that important, and a whisper is enough.

In this way, every button gets associated with a volume level for the way we want to talk to the user.

| Emphasis | Button |
| :--- | :--- |
| Yell !!!! | Danger button |
| Shout !!! | Primary button |
| Cheer ! | Secondary button |
| Murmur | Icon button |
| Whistle | Link button and Contextual button |

## Hierarchy in the layout

A hierarchy should also be established on every screen between the elements that make it up and the actions present. Two fundamental rules will be defined for that purpose:

### **Rule 1: Every screen should have a single main button**

Every layout should have **a single primary button** to put the user's focus and attention on the main action.

### **Rule 2: Other complementary buttons**

The main layout action can be accompanied by other buttons with less emphasis to establish a hierarchy between the actions on the screen.

:::note
When several main actions need to coexist in the same layout, for example, when there is a list of services the user can activate, the **small button** variant should be used.
