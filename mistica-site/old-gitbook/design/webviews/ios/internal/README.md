# Internal

We define internal webviews as webviews used for keeping the user inside Novum app throughout the whole flow, and they are not aware of being in a webview. This webview mode should be applied to show only internal websites, those that are prepared to work as part of our app simulating a native screen.

**It can have 2 types of presentation**
