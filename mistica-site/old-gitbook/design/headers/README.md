# Headers

![](../../.gitbook/assets/header-cover.png)

This documentation aims to establish guidelines for using the headings that are part of the _MÃ­stica_ design system.

The objective is to know the typologies and the difference in structure between the app and desktop headers, not only at the construction level. It will also serve as a guide to learn how these structures can help us communicate a message depending on the context in which we are working, and the objective thereof.
