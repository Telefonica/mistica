description: How do we communicate with users?

# Use

A header serves to **highlight relevant content** or **serve as a guide** for the user, either giving greater emphasis to content within the context of a page or as additional information to the content that will then be presented to the user.

## Language type

When designing a header, we must ask ourselves two questions: what do we want to communicate and how do we want to do it?

The modularity of elements allows us to use these headers to help users quickly understand information \(or simplify more complex information\) and display the main actions of a screen.

The content presented may vary depending on the purpose of the screen that we are designing and the intention with which we want to communicate with users.

We use various elements to build these headings and help us communicate the message in the best way possible, with the body of text being the only mandatory element.

The type of language we use will range from a more functional language to a more conversational one, which establishes a dialogue with the user.

### Functional structure

We can build functional headers in which the elements are arranged in a structured way, allowing the user to identify them quickly and independently.

### Conversational structure

Alternatively, we can design more organic content utilising conversational language, where the user is provided with all of the information of the message in the same sentence.
